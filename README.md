# Ultima-Tek

*Ultima-Tek* is a turn-based board game inspired by the *Ultimate* team sport played with a flying disc: throw the disc, move your pieces, bluff and surprise your opponent with bonus / penalty effects!

*Ultima-Tek*  is a game for 2 players that requires tactical and strategic thinking, while providing fun thanks to a dose of chance and bluff on the bonus / penalty effects. Children can easily play it, in particular by giving them an advantage over their number of bonuses / penalties.
